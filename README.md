# posterr_test
App for assessment purpose developed by Th√°ricki Pereira using Flutter.

# Critique
* Improvment
  * This project was developed using clean archtecture, SOLID patterns and BloC as state manager. I could do better the application of these designs or tools if i got more time, but the stucture that was created will the improvement of the code. 
  * I did separate the responsabilities of each part in code, but i could did it better with more single-function concept, avoiding using class or methods that does more than one job.
  * I would use some libraries or design patterns to improve the UI, allowing a better user experience and making the app more attractive.
  
* Crash reports strategy
  * In the case of the app are not working properly as he would to be, i would use some marketing strategies to make some time until me or the team find the bugs or what is causing the problem and solve them. Maybe send some emails or push notifications to inform the users that the teams is aware of the problems and are working to solve them as soon is posible.
  
* Improving the app for many users
  * As the app was created thinking in a modular design, to improve the app for thousands of users and a big amounth of posts will be a more easier task. We could separate the structure of the app in parts and improve each one of them, making better the form as we treat the requests and responses from API, using some libs that will manage the data and paginate this in a better way to avoid slowness. Also we can making changes in the UI to make that some slow process don't be a negative point for the users and doesn't look like the app crashes (the use of good loading animations is always a important point).
